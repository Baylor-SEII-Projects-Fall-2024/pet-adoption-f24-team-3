# Generating Mock Data and Populating Our Database

## Generating Data

<https://www.mockaroo.com> has some useful utilities in order to generate
random values to initially seed our database in. However, there are some
drawbacks.

Mockaroo does not support repeated data, such as "Center", or "Owner", that
stays constant across every instance of that generated data. Instead, I
wrote a script that adds this information for each entity instance.

There is also no way (to my knowledge) to specify enums (such as petAgeClass
or petSize).

**This data should be generated in a determistic fashion for reproducibility
across developers**

## Scripting

I generated (potentially with the help of AI) a python script that generates
random values to populate our database with.

Different animals will have ages and sizes corresponding to the specific
type of animal. For example, cats and rabbits have different life spans,
so their actual age will correspond to different ageClass enums. I have
implemented similar relationships to the animal sizeClass enum.

## Running the Script

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 generate.py
```

## TODO

Add Faker calls to create realistic data.

* First name, last name
* Pet name?
* Parse the faker returned address into street addr, city, state

Preload specific center names.

## Things to think about

* What to do with ids? Should I insert data for centers, users, insert into
  database, then query for the id generated by the database in order to link
  images, preferences, pet posts, events?

* SQLdump after generating data?
