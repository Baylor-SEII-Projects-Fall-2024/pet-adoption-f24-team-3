#   - File header added
#   - Add ickoxii/cicd-init for testing
# Modified:       09/17/2024
#   - Copied from template actions yml file
#   - Changed to docker/ci.docker-compose.yml file
#
# If we need to change runners, go to github > settings > actions > runners,
# and add the prod label to whatever runner we are switching to.

        # builds. Using `docker image prune -af` here will free up some space, but

        # GCP instance to free up additional cached objects if you are running
        # out of storage space.
