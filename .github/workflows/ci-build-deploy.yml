        # This step builds both the frontend and backend docker images using
        # Docker Compose. To change how the images are built or their actual
        # buildscripts, modify the corresponding files in the docker/ directory.

        # This script simply runs the images that were built in the previous step.
        # This uses the same Docker Compose file in the previous step.
        #
        # If the frontend and backend are already running on the VM, we first
        # need to stop them to free the port and delete them to free the
        # container name before trying to start the new versions
        #
        # It is important you prune your docker repository after all containers
        # are deployed. This is because all images used in the build stages are
        # saved by docker; this can quickly consume a lot of memory after a few
        # builds. Using `docker image prune -af` here will free up some space, but
        # you may want to consider running `docker system prune -f` on your
        # GCP instance to free up additional cached objects if you are running
        # out of storage space.
        #
        # This command assumes that the docker compose is also set up to properly
        # manage a MYSQL server.
        #
        # You will need to point these commands to the correct Docker Compose file.
